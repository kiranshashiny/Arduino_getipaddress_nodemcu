Simple script to get the Ip address of the ESP8266/nodemcu while connected to the network ( a home router, or a local Access point )

It is required to populate this code with the right SSID and the Password to connect to the network and get the IP address.

To use this :  Upload this code using the Arduino IDE to NodeMCU connected via the serial port ( e.g: SLAB_USBtoUART) and use a serial monitor like CoolTerm to see the output.
